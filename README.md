> Turning particle-detector traces and night-sky photons into insight.

Hello — I’m Paolo (giro94). I’m a Senior Postdoctoral researcher working at the intersection of experimental high-energy physics and large-scale data analysis. By day I design and maintain data-reconstruction and analysis workflows for particle physics; by night I capture the skies and process deep-sky images as an amateur astrophotographer. I focus on robust, reproducible software for high-throughput computing (HTC) environments and enjoy making complex pipelines simple, testable, and performant.
